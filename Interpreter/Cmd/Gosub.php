/*
 * Gosub simulates a jump to a label, executing all following statements until return, where it jumps back.
 * Because basic allows only jumps out of block, but not into, the GOSUB .. RETURN statement works like that:
 * Gosub is a Block statement with no children first, because they are added during parsing.
 * On executing, it copies all children of the main program as its children.
 * Next is returning each child statement as regular blocks do.
  * Return in a non-function context removes the children and returns the parent of GoSub.

  * The reason is, that if GoSub happens in a block (for, while, if), return is not allowed to jump back.
